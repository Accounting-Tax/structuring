# SME Structuring (Part 1) (Summary)

## 1. Overview of Structuring Objectives
- **Asset Protection**: Structuring to shield personal and business assets from risk.
- **Optimizing After-Tax Returns**: Ensuring the structure is tax-efficient.
- **Future Exit Strategy**: Preparing for a smooth transition or sale in the future.
- **Effective Financing**: Setting up structures that allow for efficient financing options.

## 2. Structuring Stages
- **Set-Up**: Establishing the business structure, whether a proprietary company or partnership.
- **Introduction of Outside Parties**: Bringing in investors or new partners, often through the sale or allotment of shares.
- **Exit or Sale**: Preparing for a business sale or restructuring, with a focus on tax concessions and asset protection.

## 3. Costs of Getting Structuring Wrong
- **Administrative Burden**: Incorrect structuring may lead to complex administrative tasks.
- **Trapped Losses**: Inability to fully utilize losses if the structure doesn’t allow it.
- **Missed Tax Concessions**: Structuring may prevent access to CGT or other tax concessions.
- **Restructuring Costs**: The financial and administrative burden of having to restructure a company.

## 4. Proprietary Companies
- **Large vs Small**: Companies are classified based on financial results:
  - **Large Proprietary Companies**: Have at least $50M in revenue, $25M in assets, and 100 employees.
  - **Small Proprietary Companies**: Below these thresholds but still subject to certain regulatory requirements.
  
## 5. Set-Up: Asset Protection
- **Family Trusts and Corporate Trustees**: Often used for asset protection.
- **Bankruptcy Considerations**: Ensuring that key family assets are controlled by individuals not financially exposed.
- **Limited Liability**: A major benefit of corporate structures, though courts can pierce the corporate veil in cases of insolvency.

## 6. Set-Up: Streaming Income
- **Trust Structures**: Family trusts owning shares can stream income effectively to reduce tax burdens.
- **Franking Credits**: Consideration of how franking credits are passed to beneficiaries.

## 7. Set-Up: Accessing Tax Losses
- **Continuity of Ownership Test (COT)**: Requires 50% or more of the company’s shares to be held by the same persons in order to carry forward tax losses.
- **Same Business Test (SBT)**: If ownership changes, the company must continue the same business to utilize losses.

## 8. Set-Up: Benefit of Franking Credits
- **45-Day Rule**: Shares must be held for at least 45 days to claim imputation credits on dividends.
- **Trust Beneficiaries**: Beneficiaries must have a fixed interest in the trust’s assets to claim franking credits.

## 9. Set-Up: Company Loans and Division 7A
- **Division 7A**: Prevents interest-free loans to shareholders by requiring compliant loan terms and repayment schedules.

## 10. Introduction of Outside Parties
- **Allotment of Shares**: Selling or issuing ordinary shares to new investors.
- **Value Shifting**: Ensuring that share allotments don’t unfairly reduce the value of existing shareholders' interests.

## 11. Exit Strategy and CGT Concessions
- **Small Business CGT Concessions**: These can provide planning opportunities for exiting or selling a business.
- **Significant Individual Test**: Key for accessing CGT concessions, requiring an individual to hold at least 20% of the business.

## 12. Summary of Key Considerations
- **Legal and Financial Advice**: Always seek professional advice when setting up, restructuring, or exiting a business.
- **Tax Efficiency and Asset Protection**: The right structure can balance these two crucial objectives.
